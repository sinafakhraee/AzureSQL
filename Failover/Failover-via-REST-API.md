# How to call Azure SQL Failver via REST API using Postman on Windows
---
### Create a [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) to get Bearer token in order to authenticate the client application (e.g. postman) to call the rest api. 

1. Login to azure using [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and select your active subscription

5. Right click on AzureSQLFailoverREST collection and click edidt. Select variables tab. Here we will set the collection level variables which are used by the REST APIs in the collection (here we only have one post request)
&nbsp;![alt text](https://github.com/sinafakhraee/AzureSQL/blob/main/Failover/images/vars.PNG)  
**clientid** is the value of appId from the service principal creation output above.\
**clientSecret** is the value of password from the service principal creation output above.\
**tenantId** is the value of tenamt from the service principal creation output above.\
**resourse** is https://management.azure.com/ \
If you dont have failover group and SQL DB setup,please go through this [Tutorial: Add an Azure SQL Database to an autofailover group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/failover-group-add-single-database-tutorial?tabs=azure-portal) and fill out the rest of variables accordingly. \
**bearerToken** will be generated by the [pre-request script](https://github.com/sinafakhraee/AzureSQL/blob/main/Failover/js/pre-request-script.js). You dont need to fill this here. 
### Execute the post request
1. Submit the post request which would return the opertaion and start time.

2. Click on response header and note the Azure-AsyncOperation which can be invoked to get the status of the asynchronous failover operation.

3. Create a new Get request in the same collection in order to use the variables we have already setup (token, subscription, etc.) and paste the Azure-AsyncOperation url from 2. submit the request and you will see the status of the failover operation.
